# assignment_githuh
Build a Command Line Interface for getting information on GitHub users' accounts.

To use Command Line command githuh, you must create an auth.js in the main directory that will be used to authenticate you when making
API calls to Github's API. auth.js should export an object with keys username and password.

You may customize your callback functions in the bin/githuh.js file. You may also need to call npm link to get a global syslink for 
the CLI to work.
